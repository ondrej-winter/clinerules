# Logging conventions: module-level logger standard and exceptions

Use these rules to keep logging consistent and filterable across modules.

This file governs logging implementation mechanics. Broader code-quality expectations still live in `01-core-standards.md`.

## Default logger pattern
- **Must** define a module-level logger in any module that emits logs:
  - `LOGGER = logging.getLogger(__name__)`
- **Must** use the module-level `LOGGER` inside functions and class methods.
- **Must not** create per-instance loggers like `self._logger` by default.

## Message construction and levels
- **Must** use lazy log formatting (`LOGGER.info("user_id=%s", user_id)`) instead of eager f-strings in log calls.
- **Should** keep messages stable and searchable; put highly variable details in structured context when possible.
- **Should** choose log levels by operational actionability (`debug` for diagnostics, `info` for state transitions, `warning` for recoverable anomalies, `error` for user-visible or operator-visible failures).

## Context and structure
- **Should** include structured context via `extra={...}` for operational logs.
- **Should** use stable field names for recurring concepts (`request_id`, `job_id`, `component`, `adapter`, etc.).
- **Should** include `component` or equivalent context when class attribution is useful.
- **Should** propagate request, correlation, or job IDs when available.
- **Must not** put secrets or very high-cardinality raw values into structured fields by default.
- **Must** keep logger names hierarchical by using `__name__` to support selective filtering.

## Exception logging
- **Should** log an exception once at the boundary that can handle, translate, or report it.
- **Must** avoid duplicate full-stack logging at multiple layers for the same failure.
- Use `LOGGER.exception(...)` when the stack trace is useful at that boundary; otherwise log contextual information and re-raise or translate with `from err`.

## Exceptions
- **May** use instance-specific loggers only when behavior requires runtime logger names or explicit logger injection.
- **Must** document the reason in a short inline comment when deviating from the default pattern.

## Central configuration
- **Must** configure logging through the central logging configuration utilities.
- **Must not** duplicate global logging setup in feature modules.
